## Gameplay

These are just the highlights, there are many more mods included!

### Vicious Wastes
- [Vicious Wastes](https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/56671) is the core overhaul mod featured in The Sands. It is highly recommended to read through the description if you are unfamiliar with the mod, as it drastically overhauls existing mechanics and adds some new ones. The goal of Vicious Wastes is to create a much more challenging and interesting experience without making the game completely unrecognizable for new players. Combat is deadlier, skills matter more, the economy is tougher, and progression is more rewarding. One major change that The Sands makes from regular Vicious Wastes is lowering the level cap to 25 (compared to 30) but rewarding a perk point every level (compared to every other level). In my opinion, perks are the most fun and interesting part of character building, so I wanted them to be plentiful while still not going overboard. A level cap of 25 with a perk every level results in the same amount of perks as vanilla (level cap of 50, perk every other level).
