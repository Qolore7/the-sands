## Introduction

The Sands A modlist focused on making the Mojave Wasteland more deserving of its name. The Sands aims to create difficult gameplay that rewards the player for proper planning and execution, while also improving/re-working copious amounts of vanilla content. New content has also been added to flesh out areas of the game I felt were lacking, but all new content is of an extremely high quality and integrates seamlessly into the game world.
## List Contents

You can browse the full list contents [here](https://loadorderlibrary.com/lists/the-sands) if you want to know exactly what you're getting.

You can find a summary of all changes on the [Gameplay Changes](GAMEPLAY.md) page.

## Requirements:

- An fresh installation of the **English** version of the game with the full paid Anniversary Upgrade DLC from Steam or GOG
  * The paid Anniversary Upgrade is required, full stop.
  * Only the English version is supported. I understand that this may be frustrating for non-English speaking users, but due to the core file differences between the different versions, only one version can be supported. 
  * The game MUST be installed outside of any default Windows folders, such as `Program Files`, your `Desktop`, or `Documents`. If you have your Steam library in any of these locations, please follow [these](https://github.com/LostDragonist/steam-library-setup-tool/wiki/Usage-Guide) instructions to move it.

- [Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable Package](https://aka.ms/vs/16/release/vc_redist.x64.exe)

- The latest release of [Wabbajack](https://github.com/wabbajack-tools/wabbajack/releases) installed outside of any default Windows folders.

# Installation:

## Starting Fallout New Vegas
Start the game and exit once you're at the main menu. This will ensure any settings files needed by Wabbajack are created.

## Downloading and Installing

The download and installation process can take a little while (an hour or more) depending on your system specs. For optimal speed, it is advised to install Wabbajack and the modlist to an SSD.

1. Create a folder for the modist outside of any default Windows folders called **The Sands** (I recommend `C:\Games\The Sands`) 
3. Launch the Wabbajack app and select `Browse Modlists`
4. Make sure `Show Unofficial Lists` is checked and search for `The Sands`
5. Select the **Download** icon in the bottom right, then select he **Play** icon once the download is finished
7. In the **Modlist Installation Location** box, select the `The Sands` folder you created in the first step
  * The Resource Download Location box should automatically fill in `The Sands\Downloads`, but you can move this folder to a different drive if are low on space
8. Click the Go/Begin button and wait for Wabbajack to finish

## Problems with Wabbajack

There are a lot of different scenarios where Wabbajack will produce an error. I recommend re-running Wabbajack before posting anything. Wabbajack will continue where it left off so you won't lose any progress.

**REMINDER:** This list does not work with non-English and non-Steam/GOG versions of the game. 

If you have any other installation issues, I may need to update the list. Please drop by the [Discord](https://discord.gg/SZGAXZYtHf) to report any errors!

# Startup

Open the installation folder and double click on the program called `ModOrganizer.exe`.

IMPORTANT:
If you use the GOG version of the game, activate all the mods under the **GOG Support** separator

Make sure the dropdown box on the right is set to `The Sands` and press the Run button.

You're all set! Everything is already configured by default so you can hope right into a new game!
